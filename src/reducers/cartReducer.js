It was the first iPhone to use an OLED screen. The home buttons fingerprint sensor was replaced with a new type of authentication called Face ID, which used sensors to scan the user face to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones.',
